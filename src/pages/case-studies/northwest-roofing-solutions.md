## About the client
NorthWest Roofing Solutions is a family-run roofing contractor specialising in slate, tile and flat roofing across Liverpool, Wirral and wider Merseyside. Most work comes from homeowner referrals, but the team wanted a professional online presence to handle bigger projects.

## The challenge
The existing site was slow, hard to update and lacked proof of recent jobs. Call tracking showed potential customers dropping off because the portfolio looked dated and there were no clear service areas.

## The solution
- Ran a kickoff workshop to nail their ideal customers, pain points and differentiators.
- Produced new copy focused on roof replacements, repairs and maintenance with location-specific landing pages.
- Designed a clean, mobile-first experience with project galleries and testimonials.
- Implemented conversion tracking for calls and quote requests, plus integrated HubSpot forms with automations.
- Enrolled the team on our Growth Care plan to ship two new project pages every month.

## The results
- 112% increase in tracked enquiries within the first 90 days.
- 18 new project pages published across Liverpool, Wirral and Southport.
- The team now has clarity on which services drive the highest value thanks to monthly analytics snapshots.

## What’s next
With foundations in place, the focus is on adding maintenance plan upsells, launching paid search landing pages and continuing to document projects as they happen.
