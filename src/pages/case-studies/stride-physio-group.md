## About the client
Stride Physio Group operates three physiotherapy and sports injury clinics across the North West, offering rehab programmes, shockwave therapy and specialist classes.

## The challenge
Each clinic had its own outdated microsite, creating confusion for patients and staff. Admin teams were manually confirming bookings and struggling to keep treatment pages up to date.

## The solution
- Consolidated all three locations into a single site with location switcher and dynamic contact cards.
- Rewrote treatment copy to focus on patient outcomes and aftercare, with clear insurance and pricing info.
- Integrated Cliniko for online bookings, automated appointment reminders and synced intake forms.
- Built an SEO-friendly resources hub for injury guides and return-to-sport checklists.
- Trained the internal marketing coordinator to update content and publish new resources in minutes.

## The results
- 68% increase in online bookings across the three clinics within the first quarter.
- Average time to update treatment pages dropped from 45 minutes to under 10.
- Positive feedback from patients citing clearer information and quicker confirmation emails.

## What’s next
We’re now rolling out clinic-specific landing pages for paid campaigns and creating downloadable recovery plans to nurture leads.
