## About the client

- Structured service pages (RHS Level 1–3, damp/timber, EPCs, floorplans) with clear CTAs.
- Enrolled on our Growth Care plan to add two new content pages per month.
- Connected Analytics and Search Console; implemented privacy & cookie controls.

## The results
- Clear navigation and calls-to-action improved enquiries.
- New content cadence supports local SEO and keeps the site visibly active.
